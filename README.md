# Learning through Projects

## A backstory

When I started this, my children were teenagers going to an [International Baccalaureate](https://www.ibo.org/) school.  The IB program is highly project based and as part of their [Middle Years Programme](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/middle-years-programme/), the kids need to complete a personal project.  My eldest choose to learn about the history of AI and to a build game-playing bot. If I was going to be "helpful", I'd need to learn about the topic deeply enough to teach it to a 15 year old (someone with basic programming knowledge and no calculus yet).

On the off chance, the others might find it useful, I stated thinking about how I might post the content on the internet; turn the teaching into its own project.  With that, this site was born.

## What's here

This is organized into three sections:

 * **Projects**

   Each project has at its core an **open-ended** idea to prompt exploration of a topic and includes a set of smaller *solved* projects that folks can use to develop pertinent skills.

 * **Lessons**

   A set of posts that can be used to learn about a topic in depth.  Since this is targeted to teenagers, the lessons are targeted towards that level of experience (e.g. math level no higher than algebra and little to know programming experience.)  This is presented as a independent section since the lessons likely apply to multiple projects.

 * **Blog**

   Random thoughts about learning and doing projects.
